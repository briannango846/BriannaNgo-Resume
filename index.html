        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Brianna Ngo and I am a first year pre-business major at the University of California, Riverside. I graduated from Rosemead High School in the year of 2020. I have not had the chance to be a part of a professional company, but I have had some experiences in the working field. My passion for leading and working with others can be traced back to highschool. Whether as a member of my high school Associated Student Body organization or part of my schoolâ€™s SAGATHS cabinet, I have enjoyed helping and working with others for a while. The reason? I like to learn new things about people, such as their strengths, and getting to communicate with them. Right now, that is at Kumon, a tutoring program where I currently work at.<br><br>

        At Kumon, we present our own type of classwork and homework for students to enhance their math and reading skills for their age group. As a tutor at Kumon, I help the preschool and kindergarten class with their academic skills. I would help them learn their ABCâ€™s, vowels, vocabulary, and mathematical problems. During the time I tutor them, I also get to create a bond and relationship with these students which allows them to be more comfortable with me. Working at Kumon for over a year now, I get to see these kidsâ€™ academic skills improve. Throughout my junior year of highschool, I had a chance to volunteer at a nursing home in my community. At Pine Grove Healthcare and Wellness Center, I was able to become a volunteer for their activities program. I was given the opportunity to work around the medical field, where acting professional was required from me. In the beginning of this experience, I was only able to play physical activities with those placed in the nursing home in the centerâ€™s activities room. But as I grew more into the environment and gained more experience and trust with the workers, I was able to do rounds by myself. I would go to each personâ€™s room to communicate with them and try to encourage them to use their senses and do some physical activities. Such as stretching, coloring, reading a book, and listening to music. <br><br>

        Outside of school and work, I am committed to learning new skills and trying out new things. I am fluent in Cantonese and Vietnamese, and am always looking to brush up my language skills over brunch or coffee. If you challenge me to a bake off or a cook off, I will win. I currently am trying my hand at a food blog on Instagram. I love trying new foods and being able to express my opinions on the foods I try. I want to influence others to try new foods and experience the different cultures that are related to the foods made. Whenever I have freetime, I enjoy working out and buying unnecessary things from Target.
